Prepare the enclosure
==========================

If you chose to drill the enclosure yourself, you can download and print [this drill guide](/sources/drill_guide_1590bb_motherboard_v1.pdf) (right-click, save link as).

I will not cover how to do this here, but generally, mark the wholes with a center punch first, use progressively bigger drill bits and check regularely the fit of each components to avoid any mistake.

A step-drill is great for this.
