Get the parts (BOM)
==========================

## Parts

To replicate the exact guitar pedal pictured on the front page, you will need to order all parts listed in this [BOM (Bill of Materials)](/sources/bom_motherboard_v1.csv).

Pay close attention to the comments in this BOM since some parts are optional. 

To build you own custom version, feel free to change values or even ignore the parts marked as *optional*.

## Enclosure

You can chose to order a blank enclosure (you will need to drill it yourself), or order the exact same pre-drilled and UV printed enclosure as seen on the front page.

### Hammond 1590BB

The PCB has been designed to fit nicely in a Hammond 1590BB enclosure. I do not recommend using anything smaller than that. 

Here is the exact white enclosure pictured on the front page:

### Custom drilled

If you order through [Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com), you have the option to get the enclosure drilled to your specifications.

To do so, you need to order a [custom drill enclosure service](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/1590bb-custom-drill-enclosure-service.html) (in addition to the enclosure).

Once you passed your order, you will need to send the drill guide on [drill.taydakits.com](https://drill.taydakits.com/). 

I have already prepared a drill guide that you can use [here](https://drill.taydakits.com/box-designs/new?public_key=Q3d1SDJhODNSeXo1cDE1dlVFVG1pQT09Cg==).

**Important:** The drill guide is for the pedal pictured on the front page, with 4 knobs and 2 footswitches. If you plan on building a different version of the pedal, remove the holes that you do not need from the drill guide.

### UV Printed

You can also get the enclosure UV printed from Tayda.

For this you need to order an additional [uv printing service](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/hardware/enclosures/enclosure-uv-printing-service/1590bb-uv-printing-service.html).

Once you passed your order, you need to submit a UV printing template to on [drill.taydakits.com](https://drill.taydakits.com/). 

Download the [Motherboard UV print template](/sources/uv_print_1590bb_motherboard_v1.pdf) or design your own.
