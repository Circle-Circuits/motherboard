Get the parts (BOM)
==========================

## Parts

To replicate the exact guitar pedal pictured on the front page, you will need to order all parts listed in this [BOM (Bill of Materials)](/sources/BOM_motherboard.csv).

Pay close attention to the comments in this BOM since some parts are optional. 

To build you own custom version, feel free to change values or even ignore the parts marked as *optional*.


### Some considerations

#### Clipping diodes
LED vs no clipping make not much difference. No need for 3 way switch.

You may notice a huge volume drop with some Germanium diodes. If you're unsure, you can use 2 3 pins sockets to be able to try out different diodes. (insert picture of universal muff).

## Enclosure

You can chose to order a blank enclosure (you will need to drill it yourself), or order the exact same pre-drilled and UV printed enclosure as seen on the front page.

### Hammond 1590BB

The PCB has been designed to fit nicely in a Hammond 1590BB enclosure. I do not recommend using anything smaller than that. 

Here is the exact white enclosure pictured on the front page:

### Custom drilled

If you order through [Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com), you have the option to order the enclosure pre-drilled.

To do so, you need to order a [custom drill enclosure service](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/1590bb-custom-drill-enclosure-service.html) (in addition to the enclosure).

Once you passed your order, you will need to send the drill guide on [drill.taydakits.com](https://drill.taydakits.com/). 

I have already prepared a drill guide that you can use [here](https://drill.taydakits.com/box-designs/new?public_key=Q3d1SDJhODNSeXo1cDE1dlVFVG1pQT09Cg==).

You can edit this drill guide as needed.

### UV Printed

On Tayda, you can also get your enclosure UV printed.

For this you need to order an additional [uv printing service](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/hardware/enclosures/enclosure-uv-printing-service/1590bb-uv-printing-service.html).

Once you passed your order, you need to submit your UV print template to on [drill.taydakits.com](https://drill.taydakits.com/). 

Download the [Motherboard UV print template](/sources/uv_print_1590bb_motherboard_v1.pdf) or design your own.
