Get the parts (BOM)
==========================

## Parts

A few options
1. [full build](/sources/BOM_motherboard.csv) To build it exactly as I do.
2. simplified build (with reduced variety of parts)
3. Simple 3 Knob and 1 footswitch Big Muff.


### Some considerations

LED vs no clipping make not much difference. No need for 3 way switch.

You may notice a huge volume drop with some Germanium diodes. If you're unsure, you can use 2 3 pins sockets to be able to try out different diodes. (insert picture of universal muff).

C14 and C17 can be both 47n, both 0.1u or 0.1u and 10n.

## Enclosure

The recommended enclosure is a Hammond 1590BB. The drill guide is provide for this enclosure.
A Hammond 1590BB2 will work just fine, only it is slightly bigger.

You have the choice to order a custom drilled enclosure at Tayda.com or a blank enclosure that you would drill yourself.
