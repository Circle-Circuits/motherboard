The Motherboard
==================

The Motherboard is an open-sourced PCB (Printed Circuit Board) based on the famous Big Muff circuit and designed as an experimentation platform rather than a 1:1 clone.

Yes, you can build a clone with this PCB, provided that you have the BOM (Bill of Materials). But where's the fun in that ?

### What's more ?

Out of the box, this circuits adds a few feature on top of the standard Big Muff series:
- A high/low gain toggle switch
- A more flexible tone control, with the BODY trimpot, based on the [AMZ Tone Control](https://www.muzique.com/lab/tone3.htm).
- A feedback loop operable via an SPST switch, with adjustable pitch and blend controls.
- Clipping diodes selection in both clipping stage, for at most 9 combinations.
- An extension bay with space for an additional potentiometer, to extend the circuit and add your own custom control.

### What's provided ?

- The schematic of the circuit
- Gerber files, to order your own PCB(s)
- A BOM to build the circuit with all options
- A drill guide to order a custom drilled enclosure from Tayda


### What's the catch ?

You're on your own now. I may not even have time to maintain or update this project. It's your turn to do some research, play around and build your own version of the circuit. :)
