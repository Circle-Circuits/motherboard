## Topology

This is indeed a Big Muff circuit, with a few additions.

The Big Muff dates back to the 70s and has since be derived into many variations by many different brands under many different names. 

While there are a lot of components involved, it is fairly straightforward to understand. Have a look at [Electrosmash](https://www.electrosmash.com/big-muff-pi-analysis)'s article if you want to know more.

## Mods

This particular circuit exposes some of the most popular modifications and allows us to appreciate the range of sonic possibilities of various Big Muffs at once.

### Input gain selection

1 toggle switch to set the input gain of the pedal. A lower input gain is handy if your signal is already distorted before the input.

### Clipping diodes selection

2 toggle switches to select the diodes of the first and second clipping stages.

### Feedback loop

A feedback loop triggered by a switch (can be a footswitch)

### Tone control

An additional “body” control that enables more or less mids to come out of the tone stack (a.k.a. [AMZ Tone Control](https://www.muzique.com/lab/tone3.htm)).

### Extension header

An extension bay with space for an additional potentiometer, to extend the circuit and add your own custom control.
