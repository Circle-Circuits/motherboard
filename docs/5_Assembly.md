Assembly
==========================

Toggle up is hi gain, silicon diode (what ref ?)
Toggle down is low gain, germanium and LED diodes.

IMPORTANT: solder the toggle switches before the potentiometers. Solder the potentiomers while everything is mounted in the enclosure.

Don't forget to cut the little stud of the potentiometers.

Try out the circuit before solder the LED ?
