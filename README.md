The Motherboard
==================

The Motherboard is an open-sourced PCB (Printed Circuit Board) based on the famous Big Muff circuit and designed as an experimentation platform rather than a 1:1 clone.

This repository provides everything you need to build the pedal pictured below: schematic, gerber files, bill of materials, drill guide and UV printing template.

## Who is this for ?

If you've already built a guitar pedal, you know how to solder parts and wire a 3PDT footswitch and jacks, then you should be fine !

If you're a pro, feel free to skip the docs and go straight to the [source files](/sources/).
