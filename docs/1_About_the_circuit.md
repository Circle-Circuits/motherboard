About the circuit
==========================

First of all, have a look at the schematic.

For printing, prefer the black and white version.

The circuit topology is indeed a Big Muff, with a few tweaks.

The Big Muff dates back to the 70s and has since be derived into many variations by many different brands under many different names. 

While there are a lot of components involved, it is fairly straightforward to understand.

This circuit exposes some of the most popular modifications and allows us to appreciate the range of sonic possibilities of various Big Muffs at once.

The mods on this circuits include:
- 2 toggle switches to select the clipping diodes of the second and third gain stages.
- 1 toggle switch to set the input gain of the pedal. A lower input gain is handy if your signal is already distorted before the input.
- An additional “body” control that enables more or less mids to come out of the tone stack.
- A feedback loop triggered by a switch (can be a footswitch)

The values for each component are close to a standard Big Muff (closer to a Ram's Head if I remember correclty).
